    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Raciel Yera was born on Morón, Ciego de Ávila, Cuba, in 1986. He received the PhD degree in Computer Science in 2016 from Central University of Las Villas, Santa Clara, Cuba, in one of the most recognized PhD programs in Ibero-America. After more than 10 years as Assistant, Associate, and Full Professor of Computer Science at University of Ciego de Ávila, Cuba, in 2022, he was awarded a two-year research grant under the Maria Zambrano/NextGenerationEU project of the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, for being Distinguished Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Jaén, Spain.
Subsequently, he was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship for developing his research project FIDELITY: Fairness and Explanations in Group Recommender Systems. Towards Trustworthiness and transparency.
<p>
He is also member of the research team in a Proyecto de Generación de Conocimiento 2024 program (ref. PID2024-161073NB-I00) (2025-2028, 60.375€). Main Researcher in 1 Project in the Cuban National Programme funded by Ministry of Informatics and Communications. He has also participated in 3 other Cuban national research projects. Secretary of ELIGE-IA, the Spanish Network on Recommender Systems Research, funded by the Spanish National Research Agency in the call Thematic Networks 2022. Organizer of special sessions in several conferences (CAEPIA 2024, FLINS-ISKE 2024, IDEAL 2024). TPC Member of ECAI 2024 and 2025. Local Chair in IDEAL 2025.
</p>
<p>
His main research outcomes have been:
<ol>
<li>The development of responsible recommender systems for improving explainability and fairness in individual and group RSs, based on computational intelligence and data engineering approaches.</li>
<li>Nutritional recommendation systems using computational intelligence approaches, to generate daily meal plans to end users, which were nutritionally-appropriated and based on their previous preferences.</li>
<li>Definition of data preprocessing methods for individual and group collaborative filtering recommender systems, able to correct inconsistent information provided by the users (natural noise).</li>
<li>The implementation of recommender systems as complement to the programming online judge, novel e-learning platform for guiding students through learning paths in math and programming problems.</li>
</ol>
